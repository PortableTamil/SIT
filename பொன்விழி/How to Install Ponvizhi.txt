To Install PonVizhi ....

PonVizhi can be installed in many versions of Windows starting from Windows 95.

Scanning has to be done from outside, and the stored BMP files have to 
used for recognition.


1. Quit all programs before  running setup.

2. Install PonVizhi as you would install any other Windows software.
    Restart windows so that setup can update the files properly.

3. Go to c:\Windows\fonts folder and refresh it, by clicking on
   VIEW - REFRESH. Check whether fonts like TAM-LFS-Kamban are there.
 
4. Launch  PonVizhi by clicking START  - PROGRAMS -  LEARNFUN SYSTEMS - PonVizhi.

5. In the case of Windows NT, PonVizhi works provided Service pack 3 has
 been installed. In case PonVizhi is not installing, try again. In NT, instead of Tamil if
 you see junk characters, then reboot the system, and then start  PonVizhi again.
 The fonts will be refreshed then.

6. In the case of Windows ME, disable all the languages except for one
 English Language version, for example, English ( American). This is
 essential, for the Tamil fonts to be seen properly. Also refresh the font folder.

Some General Important Information ....

Read the HELP inside PonVizhi before using it.

Some of the important features pertaining to this version are given below.
This information superceeds the information given in the help.

1. QuickSave will save the recoganized text ( as an RTF file ) with the same name as that of the BMP file.

2. OpenNextFile will open the file whose name contains the next number. 
   For example, the file next to sample001.bmp is sample002.bmp.

3. After clicking RemLine, click on a black point. This will remove all the black points connected with this point.

4. In this version spell check can be used only for the recoganized text. Spell Check will work only when it is activated immediately after each recognition.

5. For making font conversions easy, a few  " .fff  " files have been provided for some font formats. They can be renamed as " MyFont.fff " depending on the requirement.

6. If you do not see tamil letters in the edit box try the following one by one till you succeed .
	a. Refresh the Fonts folder by clicking Start->Settings->ControlPanel->Fonts->View->Refresh.
	b. Go to the Fonts folder. Click File->InstallNewFont. Install the fonts given in the TAMFONT folder in the PONVIZHI folder. If the InstallNewFont option is disabled, contact your vendor to make this option enabled.

7. Note that the quality of the output depends on the quality of the input. 

8. Recognition works well with fonts of size between 10 and 14.
